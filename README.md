DeLoaner provides small business owners with a Loan along with a QR-code payment application through which their customers make payments.
A part of the payments from the customers goes towards paying back the loan. The application incentivizes the use of Terra Wallet
by providing discounts to the wallet's users.

Smart contracts are created on the application with the small businesses. The smart contract was programmed using Rust. This was integrated with Terra Money.
